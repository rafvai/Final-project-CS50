            <p>Welcome to my web application Limitless, created as my final project for CS50, the online course in computer science offered by Harvard University. As a passionate physiotherapist with a love for sports and a current student of computer science, I am excited to share with you my project, a Flask app designed to help athletes and patients in general identify irregularities in muscle flexibility, strength imbalances, or compensations which result in functional movement weaknesses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The app is based on the concept of Functional Movement Screening (FMS), which assesses the body as a whole, including its coordinated movement of the brain and nervous system to create different movement patterns. By evaluating the body's movement patterns, the FMS can identify potential injury risk factors and functional weaknesses that could impact an individual's athletic performance or daily activities.</p>

            <p>As part of my CS50 final project, I have applied a variety of computer science concepts that I have learned during my studies to create a responsive, user-friendly platform that is easy to navigate and understand. I have utilized Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, to build the app and incorporated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user interface.</p>

            <p>I am dedicated to providing high-quality service and support to my users. I understand that my project is just the beginning, and I am committed to improving and expanding my platform in the future. I welcome your feedback and suggestions as I work towards creating a comprehensive, user-friendly app that can help athletes and patients in general to improve their movement patterns and reduce their risk of injury.</p>

            <p>Thank you for choosing my CS50 final project as your go-to app for Functional Movement Screening. I am excited to continue learning and growing as I work towards making a positive impact on the world through the power of computer science and physiotherapy.</p>
